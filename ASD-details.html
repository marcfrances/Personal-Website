            <p>
                I was assigned as XR lead for this project. This was one of the first AR applications I have ever created. It involved working with the Boise School district and its special needs programs. We were tasked with finding a learning solution that uses augmented reality to help kids who are on the spectrum. Resources such as therapy for these kids are usually not an option since its is both expensive and very limited due to the low number of therapists. This method allows them a cheap and interactive way of learning in school. The team developed this application in Unity3D for IOS and Android. Through multiple meetings with our client, we agreed that simple puzzles would be a good start. I came up with the idea of using physical cards that can be augmented using image tracking. The idea is for students to use their camera to look the cards which will augment a virtual button that they can press. This will take them into a lesson that they must complete. If correct, the button should turn into an object or animal related to the question. Once the student completes each puzzle. Each of the pieces will combine into one large environment with all the animals they unlocked placed into one scene. It can be taken apart too if the student wants to look at them individually.
