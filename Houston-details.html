                              NASA SUITS (Spacesuit User Interface Technologies for Students) challenges students to design and create spacesuit information displays within augmented reality (AR) environments. I have participated in this challenge for 2 years now and was the lead developer this past semester. This challenge happens every semester, but every spring, members of the team are flown to Houston JSC to test the software. I had the great privilege of going to test. The name of our project is ARSIS (Augmented Reality Space Informatics System). It was designed with Unity3D and the HoloLens 2. The goal is to aid astronauts in navigating the lunar surface or to help in any general EVA situation. This software is also in tandem with our VR ground station. This ground station allows those on the ground to see what the astronaut can see. This is possible due to the depth sensor and LiDAR sensors on the HoloLens. The headset can create a 3D mesh of whatever it is looking at and that 3D mesh data is then transferred to that ground station. This allows those on the ground to annotate any points of interest or anything the astronaut may have missed. It can also be used in emergency situations.
                          </p>
                          <p>I learned a lot from this challenge. It allowed me to explore and implement different forms of technology. The challenge at one point required us to build a rover that would communicate only with the astronaut. This forced me to investigate physical computing again. I had little Arduino and Raspberry Pi experience, but I did the research and was able to come up and find cool solutions. We also were tasked with finding a lighting solution because our test environment was going to be dark. This also forced me to find a separate solution which ended up being 3D printing. I made a mount for the HoloLens to hold a camera light. This worked extremely well, and it got me into 3D printing. The challenge can put you into some interesting situations, but that allows you to come up with interesting solutions. Before, Iâ€™ve I had only software solutions. Now I have some hardware solutions!
